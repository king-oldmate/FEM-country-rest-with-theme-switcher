## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

**CSS Variables:** Prior to this project I had been using TailwindCSS for everything. I still like TailwindCSS, but using it so soon meant that my uh.. pure CSS was lacking significantly. This was just one thing that I had never even used before.

### Continued development

Still need to work on utilising APIs, it just hasn't clicked for me yet. Encapsulating it is also something I'd like to do.

### Useful resources

- [Easy Dark Mode](https://css-tricks.com/easy-dark-mode-and-multiple-color-themes-in-react/) - This article made the first time I implemented a theme switcher (this project) a breeze.
- [Thousands Separator](https://code-boxx.com/add-comma-to-numbers-javascript/) - Before I searched for this I was worried I'd have to write up a function to split and count and join and nope this was all I needed, `toLocaleString("en-US")`, sweet.
- [React loop through Object](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/react-loop-through-object) - I occasionally struggle with objects and getting the right method, and this helped a lot with these nested objects and finding what I needed.
